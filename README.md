# Learn Streamlit:
This repository is to represent how easy to design a web app using the Streamlit package. The best way to learn is to practice...

Here, you will find simple examples that you can learn from how to implement Streamlit widgets in your web app.

## Image and Histogram: [**[Code]**](https://github.com/OmarAlkousa/Learn-Streamlit/blob/main/Image_and_Histogram/app.py)
This simple web app lets you import RGB images and represent its histogram.

### In this web app, you will learn your streamlit way with:
- Using markdown language that is easy to manipulate texts.
- **st.fileuploader()** widget that lets you upload local files.
- **st.cache_data with** decorators for faster implementation of the data you're using.
- **st.plotly_chart()** to represent the plotly figures.

Below is an illustration of the app.
